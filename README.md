# tuckshop-auth-example
Simple example with oAuth from Auth0 with Create React App

## Instructions 
Firstly clone this repo

```bash
$ npm i && npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/` 

You can now login and look at the profile page. 

It uses the free plan from https://auth0.com/ which is plenty for our needs for this project. 

## Notes

This should work if you have Create-React-App installed but I **think** (not tested) that this is covered by the dev devendency of react-scripts.
